I love lists. Here's one I'm thankful for: The things I've learned since I started Prism (including those I learned indirectly):



	
  * How to negotiate a common charter.

	
  * How to navigate, edit in and configure Vim.

	
  * How to write JavaScript to make a reading interface on the web.

	
  * How to read Ruby.

	
  * The key principles of programming: a) Assignments; b) Iteration; c) I/O; d) Conditionals; e) Boolean Operations; and d) Data Structures.

	
  * The difference between an object and a method.

	
  * How to feed hungry functions.

	
  * The three parts of a Rails app: a) Views, b) Controller and c) Model.

	
  * To keep a portfolio of favorite designs.

        
  * When a constrained vocabulary meets an unbound vocabulary, magic happens.
	
	
  * How to test before you code... and watch Henry at the same time.

	
  * The licenses for software are different than the licenses for other media (I know, I'm slow).

	
  * How to use the terminal for almost everything (sorry @sramsay, still like my eye-candy).

	
  * How to Git with my eyes closed.

	
  * The basics of GIS (thanks, Kelly!)

	
  * How to run an Omeka-driven classroom.

	
  * How to run a LAMP test server on a virtual machine.

        
  * How it all ties together.

        
  * How greedy I am for more.


  



Bonus: What I will learn next week:








	
  * How to interact with an API (In my case, Zotero and Juxta will be my first dates)
