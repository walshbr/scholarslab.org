Mr. Jefferson ended his best-known sentence with “_Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness_."   The only thing missing was maps.

[![Life Liberty Pursuit of Happiness](http://www.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LifeLibertyPursuitBlogSlide-300x225.png)](http://www.scholarslab.org/digital-humanities/life-liberty-and-the-pursuit-of-mappiness/attachment/lifelibertypursuitblogslide/)

In the Scholars' Lab, we're all about the spatial goodness.   Inspired by Kansas State University’s [Seven Deadly Sins maps](http://www.wired.com/culture/education/magazine/17-09/st_sinmaps), we set about converting the qualities of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness into quantities we could visualize through maps.  Brainstorming commenced on how best to measure the unmeasurable.   Mappiness ensued.

We calculated a score for _Life_, for _Liberty_, and for the _Pursuit of Happiness_ for each county in the continental U.S. and mapped how each county's score deviated from the mean.  So our maps highlight extremes, both high and low.

_Life_ mapped combined male and female [Life Expectancy At Birth](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050066#pmed-0050066-sd002) data for 1999.** **

_Liberty_ mapped US Census datasets for 2000 to measure the [institutionalized population](http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MetadataBrowserServlet?type=subject&id=GQ_USF1&dsspName=DEC_2000_SF1&back=update&_lang=en) as a percent of the total population.

[![Pursuit of Happiness](http://www.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PursuitOfHappiness-1024x791.jpg)](http://www.scholarslab.org/digital-humanities/life-liberty-and-the-pursuit-of-mappiness/attachment/pursuitofhappiness/)

_Pursuit of Happiness_ mapped the ratio of [arts, entertainment, and recreation](http://bhs.econ.census.gov/econhelp/resources/ae-71/SEC_AE-71.html) establishments to the total population from the 2002 US Economic Census.

Transforming datasets from a spreadsheet to a map takes advantage of our  human ability to consume mass quantities of information visually.  Rows of numbers stashed away in academic journals and US  Census tables come alive when mapped to show comparisons with their neighbors both near and far.  Patterns and clusters appear.  [New questions are asked.](http://spatial.scholarslab.org/spatial-turn/) New answers come.  New maps emerge.

And here's good news:  If you find our measures of Mr. Jefferson's famous phrase lacking, software tools to [combine and manipulate datasets](http://www.scholarslab.org/geospatial-and-temporal/putting-american-community-survey-data-to-work/#more-992) that may share only common geographic markers can now [make cartographers  of us all](http://spatial.scholarslab.org/).

Happy mapping!
