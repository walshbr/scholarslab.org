**Democratizing the Digital Humanities: The American Yawp as Case Study**

After a year-long collaboration, over 350 historians have produced a beta edition of [The American Yawp](http://www.americanyawp.com), a free and online, collaboratively built, open American history textbook designed for college-level history courses. This talk will explore the creation and dissemination of this project, the landscape of open educational projects in the humanities, the methods used to harness the energy of hundreds of academics, and the potential for large-scale collaboration and open resources to make practical the democratic promise of the digital humanities.
