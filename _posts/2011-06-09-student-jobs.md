Are you a maker? A builder? A tinkerer at heart?

The [Scholars’ Lab](http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab) in Alderman Library seeks energetic and imaginative UVa graduate students from all disciplines looking to hone their digital skills. Interested in cutting-edge technologies for the digital humanities and interpretive or humanistic social sciences? Want hands-on experience in project management and the design of innovative, beautiful, and useful tools for scholarship and cultural heritage?  We encourage you to apply for this apprenticeship opportunity with our [Research and Development team](http://scholarslab.org)!

[![get excited and make things](http://www.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/sign1.png)](http://www.scholarslab.org/announcements/student-jobs/attachment/sign1/)Scholars’ Lab R&D is engaged in a number of projects leveraging textual encoding techniques, advanced search services, geo-temporal visualization, relational database systems, and modern Web development frameworks.  The intent of these assistantship positions is to allow you to work as part of a team, learning design, coding, and project management skills that will be invaluable to your own research and make you highly marketable within the broad field of the digital humanities.

Students will have the opportunity to partner on Scholars' Lab collaborations with UVa faculty and to help test [Omeka plug-ins](http://www.scholarslab.org/projects/omeka-plugins/) and craft geo-temporal scholarly arguments using [Neatline](http://www.scholarslab.org/announcements/scholars-lab-and-chnm-partner-on-omeka-neatline/), a tool we're building with funding from the Library of Congress and in partnership with the [Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu).  We'll also be undertaking a brand-new project with our R&D assistants in Fall 2011: "Crowdsourcing Interpretation."

These are 10-hour-per-week positions with the opportunity to work longer hours in the summers and between semesters.  We hope to hire several  grad students, who may also be interested in becoming Scholars' Lab [Graduate Fellows in Digital Humanities](http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/about/fellowship.html).

UVa graduate students may apply through [CavLink](https://virginia-csm.symplicity.com/students/index.php).  Search for "Scholars’ Lab Research & Development Assistant."
