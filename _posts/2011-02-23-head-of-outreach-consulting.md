We're excited to announce a fantastic job opportunity: a faculty-level position at the University of Virginia Library with responsibility for running public services in our growing and well-respected [Scholars' Lab](http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab).  



### Head of Outreach and Consulting


Are you an excellent and enthusiastic communicator with a strong background in technological approaches to humanities and social science scholarship? UVa Library seeks a **Head of Outreach and Consulting** to coordinate public services in our internationally-recognized Scholars' Lab. The ideal candidate is detail-oriented, eager to work collaboratively, and able to represent -- to internal and external audiences -- UVa Library’s involvement in the digital humanities. This supervisory position is responsible for day-to-day operations in the Scholars’ Lab (overseeing staff dedicated to geospatial, data-driven, and text-based research consultation) and plays a key role in our program for [Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities](http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/about/fellowship.html).  This position reports to the Library's Director of Digital Research & Scholarship.

The position is for a true “hybrid" or "alternative academic” — someone with a strong service ethic and sense of hospitality who can also collaborate as a true intellectual partner with faculty and graduate students, enabling next-generation DH in the Scholars’ Lab. The Head of Outreach and Consulting should also be able to take good advantage of the “20% time” that all Department of Digital Research & Scholarship faculty and staff are granted to pursue professional development and their own (often collaborative) R&D; projects.  This is a full-time, permanent general faculty position at UVa.

Outreach and Scholars’ Lab Management: oversight of day-to-day operations and consulting services, coordination of intellectual programming (speaker series, workshops, etc.) and organization of Graduate Fellows program; Scholarly Projects Consultation: development of intake process, workplans, and MoUs for new scholarly collaborations, in consultation with Scholars’ Lab R&D; Education and Professional Development: pursuit of own scholarly R&D; agenda related to the humanities or social sciences and publication of results and/or presentation at appropriate conferences.



### Specialized Knowledge and Skills:


Working knowledge of digital humanities technologies and directions.  Strong public service orientation and interest in guiding faculty projects from conceptualization to the formulation of workable project plans.  Excellent communication skills, including the ability to present complex technical information to a generalist audience and a clear understanding of the perspectives and needs of the professoriate. Previous experience in public service in an academic library setting and experience in scholarly research, writing, and web development preferred.

**Education:**  Masters Degree or PhD in humanities or social sciences. 
**Experience:** 3 years experience with project management and/or hands-on development of digital projects related to digital humanities or cultural heritage.
**Salary and Benefits:**  Salary commensurate with experience and competitive depending on qualifications. General faculty status. Excellent benefits, including 22 days of vacation; TIAA/CREF and other retirement plans along with generous funding for travel and professional development.
