The University of Virginia Library is the hub of a lively and growing community of practice in technology and the humanities, arts, and social sciences. As part of that community, the Scholars' Lab has risen to international pre-eminence as a library-based center for digital humanities.

The Scholars' Lab collaborates with faculty, librarians, and students on a range of projects and tools, including spatial humanities, data visualization, text analysis, digital archiving, 3D modeling, and experimental humanities. Our [Praxis Program](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/) and Digital Humanities Fellowships are both models for graduate education in Digital Humanities. Further, the Library and the Scholars' Lab are committed to diversity and safe spaces, and we particularly focus our speaker series and practice on accessibility and social justice in all senses.

We welcome curious, critical, and compassionate professionals with integrity and a strong work ethic, and who possess a keen and deep understanding of what it takes to continuously improve and maintain research projects within a major academic research library.
