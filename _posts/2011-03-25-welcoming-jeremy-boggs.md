We're thrilled to announce that Jeremy Boggs will be joining the [Scholars' Lab](http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab) and the staff of UVa Library's Digital Research & Scholarship department this June, in the role of Humanities Design Architect.

[![](http://www.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/jeremy.jpg)](http://www.scholarslab.org/announcements/welcoming-jeremy-boggs/attachment/jeremy/)[Jeremy](http://clioweb.org) comes to us from the wonderful [Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu/) (CHNM) at George Mason University, where he serves as Associate Director of Research and as development manager for [Omeka](http://omeka.org), an open-source web publishing system for cultural heritage collections.  Jeremy was also one of the originators of [THATCamp](http://thatcamp.org), the popular technology and humanities "unconference." 

He is completing his doctoral dissertation at Mason, "The Designing Historian," and the UVa community has benefited from Jeremy's presence this year as a visiting scholar in the Scholars' Lab.

In his new role, Jeremy will be advising faculty and grad students on design and user experience aspects of their digital projects in both the humanities and humanistic social sciences and contributing to ongoing work in Scholars' Lab R&D;, with special attention to "[Neatline](http://www.scholarslab.org/announcements/scholars-lab-and-chnm-partner-on-omeka-neatline/)," a set of tools we're developing with funding from the Library of Congress and in collaboration with CHNM.

We look forward to welcoming Jeremy and his wife Jill to the Scholars' Lab family this summer!
