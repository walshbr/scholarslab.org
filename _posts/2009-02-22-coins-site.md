A recent post by [Ethan Gruber](/people/ethan-gruber/), a UVA Library staff member who has lately joined the Scholars' Lab team, detailed [his experiments](http://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/index.php/digital-humanities/research-applications-for-3d-models-in-art-history/) with 3-dimensional modeling to re-contextualize Roman mosaics -- right down to the interplay of light and shadow in ancient villas.  Now Ethan's work on creating a scholarly interface for the study of Greek and Roman coins has been [profiled in UVA Today](http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=7810).  This project came about through an internal UVA Library Innovation Grant and was undertaken in consultation with Art History professor John Dobbins, a 1994 [IATH](http://iath.virginia.edu) Fellow, whose [Pompeii Forum](http://pompeii.virginia.edu/) project provided an early example for the utility of digital tools for archaeological inquiry.  The rare coins were scanned by Andrew Curley of the Library's [Scholarly Resources](http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarlyresources/) Digitization Services.
