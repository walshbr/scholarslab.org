The fellowship supports ABD graduate students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development.

Fellows join our [vibrant community](http://www.scholarslab.org/graduate-fellowships/), have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, make use of our dedicated grad lounge, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per semester.

Supported by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund, and a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.

Please see the [DH Fellowship page](http://www.scholarslab.org/graduate-fellowship-in-digital-humanities/) for more information about the program, eligibility requirements, and application information. Deadline: March 10th!

Please contact[ Purdom Lindblad](mailto: jpl8e@virginia.edu), Head of Graduate Programs at the Scholars' Lab, with questions.
