I've called [Neatline](http://neatline.org/), the [Digital Humanities Start-Up](http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/digitalhumanitiesstartup.html) project Adam Soroka and I began developing in September, a "contribution to interpretive humanities scholarship in the visual vernacular."

Huh?

This project will allow scholars (and other stewards of cultural heritage) to create Web-based geospatial and temporal visualizations that build on the rich [EAD metadata](http://www.archivists.org/saagroups/ead/index.html) libraries produce in describing their archival collections and making them more discoverable -- but the crucial twist is that we didn't want to think of our Neatline visualizations as _products_ of the metadata. They're not brain-dead algorithmic output or some kind of thoughtless expression of the archivist's (nuanced, but necessarily broad) stance toward historical or literary documents of interest. (Yes, I'm asking for it; bring it on!) In other words, Neatline isn't about the parsing of placenames and automated population of timelines with data. Rather, we've conceived this tool (really, as development proceeds, this _approach_, because Neatline is emerging as an arrangement of instruments and an attitude toward their use) as a kind of _playspace for the scholarly interpretative act_. In future posts, we'll describe our development effort and I'll delve a little into the conceptual background for Neatline in the [Temporal Modelling](http://iath.virginia.edu/time) project I undertook several years ago with [Johanna Drucker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johanna_Drucker).

In the meantime, you can read about how we're employing the [Omeka](http://omeka.org) plugin framework as a way to handle GIS services for scanned historical maps on the ScholarsLab.org project pages for [Neatline-in-progress](http://www.scholarslab.org/projects/neatline/) and our larger [Omeka plugin work](http://www.scholarslab.org/projects/omeka-plugins/), or you can check out our dedicated [project blog](http://neatline.org).
