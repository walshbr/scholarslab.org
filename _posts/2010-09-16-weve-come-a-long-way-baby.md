[![](http://www.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-16-at-10.15.28-AM-124x300.png)](http://www.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/LiteratureSearching.pdf)Thanks to Megan Brett, Research Database and Records Manager at the [Montpelier Foundation](http://www.montpelier.org/), we are able share with you a piece of ephemera from UVa Library's computing past: a pamphlet on "Computer Literature Search."


<blockquote>**"Why use a computer search?** Consider the time it takes to search manually through the many issues of printed indexes. The computer searches these indexes in seconds; the search is faster, more comprehensive, and often more precise, as there are more subject access points and greater flexibility in combining terms in a computer search."</blockquote>


The pamphlet continues with an offer to split evenly the costs of search with Library patrons -- "based on computer connect-time and on the number and format of citations printed."  Check out a PDF of the pamphlet, [here](http://www.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/LiteratureSearching.pdf) (1mb).  It is coded "10-84." Is this from 1984? 

Please comment if you can shed light on the date of the pamphlet, or want to share memories of early digital and computer-assisted scholarship at UVa.  We'd also be very happy -- in the semester in which we've rolled out a [new Virgo interface](http://search.lib.virginia.edu) based on [Project Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org) (first prototyped here in the [Scholars' Lab](http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab)!) -- to see more ephemera from UVa Library's long engagement with digital research.
