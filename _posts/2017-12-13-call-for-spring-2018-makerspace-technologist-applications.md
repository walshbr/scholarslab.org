_Are you a UVA graduate student or upper-level undergraduate in the humanities? Come join our team as a Makerspace technologist!_

Our [Makerspace](http://scholarslab.org/makerspace) is designed to foster experimentation with 3D printing, modeling, and digitization, physical computing (e.g. Arduino, wearables), virtual reality, and more. For humanists, it is a good way to learn more about experimental and digital humanities by exploring new uses for digital technologies in fields that do not traditionally integrate them. No prior experience with electronics or 3D printing is needed. Successful candidates will be trained on these tools and will in turn pass on their training to disciplinarily diverse students, faculty, and staff interested in using them for fun, teaching, and research. We also strongly encourage technologists to work on their own personal projects and to develop expertise based on their own scholarly interests.

An important aspect of Maker culture is apprenticeship and supporting makers in their pursuit of professional experience. We are looking for motivated individuals who are capable of working independently and value the opportunity to engage with and support a growing community. Benefits of the job may include: access to expertise and mentoring in your field of interest, opportunities for collaboration and publication, use of equipment and tools, and ability to shape Scholars’ Lab workshops and programming.

Candidates should be able to work up to 10 hours per week. Applications should consist of a cover letter discussing their interest in working in the Scholars’ Lab, any experience or interest in participating in a maker space, and any previous experience with public service or assisting others in using technology. Please send inquiries and applications to [scholarslab@virginia.edu](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu).

Multiple openings are available for Spring semester, and review of applicants is ongoing until filled.
