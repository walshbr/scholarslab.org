The University of Virginia Library is the hub of a lively and growing community of practice in technology and the humanities, arts, and social sciences.

The Scholars’ Lab collaborates with faculty, librarians, and students on a range of projects and tools, including spatial humanities, interface design, innovative pedagogy, data visualization, text analysis, digital archiving, 3D modeling, virtual reality and gaming, and other experimental humanities approaches.

The Library and the Scholars’ Lab are committed to diversity, inclusion, and safe spaces, and we have focused recent speaker series and practice on accessibility and social justice ([check out our team-authored charter for more on our values](http://scholarslab.org/about/charter/)). We welcome curious, critical, and compassionate professionals who are keenly interested in the overlaps between technology and the humanities (literature, history, art, cultural heritage, and related fields).

The Scholars' Lab currently consists of 11 staffers (plus a senior developer role), as well as an amazing cohort of graduate fellows and makerspace technicians.
