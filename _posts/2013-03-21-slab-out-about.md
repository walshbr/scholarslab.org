SLab folks get out and about! Here’s where we’ve been over the last few months:

Bethany Nowviskie was invited to give the [Japanese Association for Digital Humanities](http://www.jadh.org/jadh2012) keynote address in Tokyo in September 2012 ("[Too Small to Fail](http://nowviskie.org/2012/too-small-to-fail/)") and to participate in one of Michael Bérubé’s MLA Presidential Forum  events on _Avenues of Access_ at the [2013 Modern Language Association meeting](http://www.mla.org/convention). Her invited talk was called "[Resistance in the Materials](http://nowviskie.org/2013/resistance-in-the-materials/)." In Boston, Bethany also participated in  roundtable discussion with fellow members of MLA's Task Force on Doctoral Study. Last semester, she and David McClure were invited to give a lecture at the University of Maryland as part of MITH's _Digital Dialogues_ series. That talk and demo, entitled [_Space, Time, and the Problem of Scale: Digital Storytelling with Neatline_](http://mith.umd.edu/podcasts/bethany-nowviskie-and-david-mcclure-space-time-and-the-problem-of-scale-digital-storytelling-with-neatline/), took place in November 2012 and was repeated at UVa. This month, she will give a workshop, seminar, and public lecture as a Lansdowne visiting scholar at the University of Victoria.

David McClure has been traveling here and there teaching and talking about [Neatline](http://neatline.org). In addition to the talk with Bethany (which they repeated at the Scholars' Lab), he and Jeremy Boggs led a web seminar for the National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education (NITLE) entitled [_Geotemporal Storytelling with Neatline_](http://www.nitle.org/live/events/147-geotemporal-storytelling-with-neatline). David also gave a two-day workshop at Beloit College and a lecture introducing Neatline at the [Alabama Digital Humanities Center](http://www.lib.ua.edu/digitalhumanities) in October 2012 entitled _Maps, Timelines, and Archives: Using Neatline to Plot Digital Collections in Space and Time_.

Katina Rogers guest taught a session at Matt Gold’s graduate seminar at CUNY entitled _Debates in the Digital Humanities: Towards a Networked Academy_ and ran a session at [THATCamp CHNM](http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/) on graduate education reform. Katina has also [guest blogged for the ProfHacker blog](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/graduate-education-reform/45043), taken part in [a roundtable at MLA 2013 on rebooting graduate education](http://katinarogers.com/2013/01/06/rebooting-graduate-training-mla/) (along with SLab Fellow Annie Swafford), and had her work featured in the Chronicle of Higher Education ([#alt-ac survey results](http://chronicle.com/article/In-Search-of-Hard-Data-on/134030/) and [graduate education reform](http://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/01/07/rebooting-graduate-education-in-the-humanities/)).

In January 2013, Eric Rochester spoke about digital tools in the [Association for Computers and the Humanities](http://ach.org) panel on interoperability entitled _Open Sesame_ at MLA 2013.

Nancy Kechner taught the Pharm D group at the UVa Medical Center to incorporate SPSS into their clinical research, allowing them to present their cutting edge results as Rounds and at conferences. Nancy's also helped the Infectious Disease group to use tools provided by the SLab to further their research.

What are we looking forward to next? [Digital Humanities 2013](http://dh2013.unl.edu) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on July 16-19!
