As the fall term begins, we are delighted to welcome our 9 (!) SLab Fellows. Ranging across 5 disciplines from the [arts, humanities, and social sciences](http://as.virginia.edu/). Our [Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities](/digital-humanities-fellows) and [Praxis Program Fellows](http://praxis.scholarslab.org) join a distinguished community of [past fellows](/people/).


## Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities


We are excited about the opportunity to work closely with our [Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities](/digital-humanities-fellows), James, Jenny, and Emily as they develop their projects. **Please join us at their [welcome lunch and panel September 12th, at 12 PM ](http://scholarslab.org/events/2014-15-scholars-lab-graduate-fellows-panel/)in the Scholars' Lab Commons.**

As a [previous post](/2014/09/08/fellows/) noted, James, Jennifer, and Emily’s projects converge around questions of social networks and mapping.

[James Ambuske’s](/people/james-ambuske/) (History) dissertation is titled “Scotland’s American Revolution: Emigration and Imperial Crisis, 1763-1803.”

[Jennifer Foy’s](/people/jennifer-foy/)  (English) dissertation is titled “Mapping Sympathy: Sensibility, Stigma, and Space in the Long Eighteenth Century”

[Emily Senefeld's](/people/emily-senefeld/) (History) project is titled “The Cultural Programs of the Highlander Folk School, 1932-1964.”

  * [Amy Boyd](/people/amy-boyd/) (English)

Past Praxis teams developed [Prism](http://prism.scholarslab.org/), a web application for crowd-based interpretations of texts, and re-imagined [Ivanhoe](http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org), a platform for playfully (and collaboratively) interpreting texts and artifacts.

This year’s cohort will refine Ivanhoe as well as explore our new [Makerspace](/makerspace/). With a talented and disciplinarily diverse team, we are looking forward to their dive into Ivanhoe. Keep track of their experiments on our [blog](/blog/)!
